    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me
Hi! I am Ruoxiao Gu, a master‚Äôs student specializing in Climate Change and Earth System Modeling at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan).My research focuses on climate simulation and the dynamics of global monsoon systems. I am passionate about programming and data visualization and deeply interested in the climatic impacts of ocean circulation and global sea ice variability. In the future, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. to further explore the vast field of climate science and contribute to climate prediction and adaptation efforts.
